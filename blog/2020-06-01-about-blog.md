# About Blog

This folder contain my weekly notes for everything I found and thought. They will be messed notes since my approach is _just write_. So they are just like semi-_zettelkasten_. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

The notes work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The flow will be look like this: 1. Write everything in a single weekly document into [Blog](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/blog/about_blog.md) folder or into [bookmarks](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/blog/bookmarks.md) note. 2. Expand some interesting snippets in a weekly document or bookmarks into a single page note in [Note](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/note/about_note.md) folder. 3. Expand the interesting [Bookmarks](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/blog/bookmarks.md) or [Blog](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/blog/about_blog.md) content into respective list-style folders, for examples:

* [App](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/app/about_app.md) folder for applications or softwares.
* [Book](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/book/about_book.md) folder for books or tutorials.
