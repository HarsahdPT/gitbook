This folder contain my weekly notes for everything I found and thought. They will be messed notes since my approach is _just write_. So they are just like semi-_zettelkasten_. Sometimes I will write in English, in the other times it will in Indonesian.

The notes work as a starting point to more deep and through notes in another folder. The flow will be look like this: 1. Write everything in a single weekly document into [Blog](about_blog.md) folder or into [bookmarks](bookmarks.md) note. 2. Expand some interesting snippets in a weekly document or bookmarks into a single page note in [Note](../note/about_note.md) folder. 3. Expand the interesting [Bookmarks](bookmarks.md) or [Blog](about_blog.md) content into respective list-style folders, for examples:

* [App](../app/about_app.md) folder for applications or softwares.
* [Book](../book/about_book.md) folder for books or tutorials.
  1. The notes in list-style folders will link-heavy notes: list of links with little explanation.
  2. Expand interesting notes in the [Note](../note/about_note.md) into a tutorial or a book in their respective project-style folders, for examples:
* [Markdown](../markdown/about_markdown.md) for book project about markdown.
* [PVSystem](../pvsystem/about_pvsystem.md) for book project about PV System.
  1. The notes in project-style folders will content-heavy notes: descriptive notes supported with citations \(links\).
