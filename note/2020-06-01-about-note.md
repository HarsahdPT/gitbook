# About Note

This folder contains more deep and detiled explanation from what I wrote in [Blog](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/blog/about_blog.md) or saved link in [bookmarks](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/blog/bookmarks.md). If I find something which is interesting and needs more explanation or description, I'll put it as a note in this repo.

A note in this folder can be expanded further into specific project-style folder, for examples:

* [Markdown](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/markdown/about_markdown.md) for book project about markdown.
* [PVSystem](https://github.com/irosyadi/gitbook/tree/d6b94fb26641805acbe8257b88f9c838c6922c13/pvsystem/about_pvsystem.md) for book project about PV System.
